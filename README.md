## Overview

Welcome to the Customer Clustering Data Science Project! In this project, we aim to explore customer segmentation using various clustering techniques. Our dataset contains information about customers, including attributes like sex, marital status, age, education, income, occupation, and settlement size. By clustering customers based on these characteristics, we can identify meaningful patterns and segments within the data.

## Data Preprocessing

In this project phase, we perform essential data preprocessing tasks:

- Import relevant libraries: We start by importing Python libraries necessary for our analysis, including pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.

- Load the data: We load the customer data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

- Initial exploration: To get a sense of the data, we check the first five rows. Then, we remove the 'ID' column as it's not needed for our analysis.

- Checking for missing values: We ensure that there are no missing values in our dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset:

- Data visualization: We create visualizations, such as bar plots, to understand the relationships between variables. For example, we examine how age is distributed across different marital statuses and education levels.

- Correlation analysis: We calculate and display the correlation matrix to identify any significant relationships between variables. This helps us understand the strength and direction of these relationships.

## K-Means Clustering

K-Means clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into clusters. Here's what we do in this phase:

- Standardization: To ensure that all variables have the same scale, we standardize the data using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

- Finding the optimal number of clusters: We apply the K-Means algorithm with varying numbers of clusters (2 to 9) and use the "elbow method" to identify the optimal number of clusters.

- Cluster visualization: We visualize the K-Means clustering results using bar plots. For example, we show how age varies across different marital statuses within each cluster.

## Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is another clustering method that reveals hierarchical relationships among data points:

- Standardization: Similar to K-Means, we standardize the data using the StandardScaler.

- Creating a dendrogram: We generate a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchical structure of the clusters. This helps us understand how the data points are linked together.

## DBSCAN Clustering

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm:

 We:
- Normalize the data using MinMaxScaler.
- Experiment with various values of hyperparameters, especially "eps" and "min_samples."
- Identify outliers and visualize them using bar plots.
